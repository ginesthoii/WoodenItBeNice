# DIY Roll-Away Nesting Boxes (6–8 Hens)

Clean eggs. Fewer broken eggs. Stops egg-eating by removing the egg from sight.

## Overview

This build is a gravity roll-away nest system. The hen lays on a slightly sloped floor and the egg rolls into a protected tray so the birds can’t peck it, sit on it, or eat it. Designed for 6–8 hens using 2–3 stalls, with external egg collection.

Recommended stalls  
2 stalls for 6 hens  
3 stalls for 7–8 hens  

Rule of thumb  
1 stall per 3–4 hens

## Core Geometry (This Is the Part That Actually Matters)

Nest depth (front to back): 14–15 1/2 in  
Nest width per stall: 12 in  
Drop lip before roll zone: 3 in  
Roll-away tray depth: 6 in  

Slope target  
7–9 degrees minimum  
10–12 degrees recommended when using turf or padding  

Too shallow: eggs stall  
Too steep: eggs thump and crack  

## Cedar-Free, Chicken-Safe Materials

Use these materials  
Exterior-grade plywood (ACX/BCX) or cabinet-grade plywood  
Titebond II or Titebond III wood glue  
18ga brad nails (1 1/4 in)  
Exterior wood screws (1 5/8 in or 2 in)  
Thin reptile turf or thin outdoor artificial grass  

Avoid these materials  
Cedar (aromatic oils can irritate chickens)  
Pressure-treated lumber inside nesting areas  
Thick bedding such as straw, hay, or deep shavings in the roll zone  

Optional finish (recommended)  
Low-VOC exterior paint or water-based polyurethane  
Allow to fully cure before birds use the nest boxes  

## Stall Count and Finished Size

3-stall version (recommended for 7–8 hens)  
Inside width: 36 in  
Nest depth: 14–15 1/2 in  
Egg tray depth: 6 in  

2-stall version (recommended for 6 hens)  
Inside width: 24 in  
Nest depth: 14–15 1/2 in  
Egg tray depth: 6 in  

## Cut List (3-Stall Version)

All plywood thickness assumed 3/4 in unless noted.

Side panels (2 pieces, mirrored)  
These create the slope and egg tray notch.

Top sloped edge length: 14 in  
Rear height: 14 1/2 in  
Front height: 15 1/2 in  
Bottom depth: 15 1/4 in  

Tray notch (front bottom corner)  
Cutout size: 6 in wide x 3 in tall  

Sloped nest floor (1 piece)  
Width: 36 in  
Depth: 14–15 1/2 in  

Top panel (1 piece)  
Width: 36 in  
Depth: same as sloped nest floor  

Dividers (2 pieces)  
Depth: same as sloped nest floor  
Height: match side panel interior height  
Spacing: 12 in between dividers  

Egg tray floor (1 piece)  
Width: 36 in  
Depth: 6 in  

Egg tray lid or cover (optional but recommended)  
Width: 36 in  
Depth: 6–8 in  

## Cut List (2-Stall Version)

Same components as the 3-stall version with adjusted widths.

Nest floor width: 24 in  
Top panel width: 24 in  
Egg tray width: 24 in  
Dividers: 1 piece  
Side panels: same shape  

## Tools

Jigsaw  
Circular saw or table saw  
Brad nailer or drill and screws  
Tape measure, square, pencil  
Clamps (optional)

## Layout Notes

Cut one side panel first and use it as a template for the second.  
Dry-fit the sloped floor against the side panels before fastening.  
The notch creates the egg tray opening and drop lip—measure carefully.

## Assembly Steps

### 1. Build the Side Panels

Cut the first side panel with the slope and tray notch.  
Trace and mirror it to make the second side panel.

### 2. Attach the Sloped Nest Floor

Apply wood glue to the contact edges.  
Set the sloped floor between the side panels.  
Brad nail through the side panels into the floor edges.

### 3. Install the Dividers

Mark divider locations at 12 in spacing.  
Apply glue to the divider bottoms.  
Fasten with two brad nails per joint to prevent pivoting.

### 4. Install the Top Panel

Apply glue to the top edges of side panels and dividers.  
Set the top panel in place and brad nail it down.  
This step locks the entire structure square.

### 5. Install the Egg Tray

Mount the tray floor under the notch area.  
Line the tray with thin turf or reptile mat.  
Eggs should roll, stop, and disappear from view.

### 6. Add a Soft Stop (Recommended)

Install a thin foam or rubber strip at the end of the tray to reduce cracking.

### 7. Seal and Cure

Seal all exposed plywood surfaces.  
Allow the finish to fully cure before installation.

### 8. Install Through the Coop Wall

Cut an opening in the coop wall matching the tray exit.  
Mount the unit so hens enter from inside and eggs exit outside.  
Add a secure lid or cover over the egg tray to deter predators.

## Placement Guidelines

Mount 12–24 in off the coop floor.  
Keep nests lower than roosts.  
Choose a darker, quieter corner of the coop.

## Common Failure Points

Eggs not rolling due to insufficient slope or thick turf  
Eggs cracking from excessive slope or lack of a soft stop  
Dirty eggs when eggs remain visible to hens  
Predator access due to missing tray cover

## Quick Recommendations

Use 2 stalls for a compact, efficient setup.  
Use 3 stalls for added flexibility and comfort.  
Avoid building more than 3 stalls for this flock size unless you have excess materials.

## Notes

This design works because chickens peck what they can see. Once the egg rolls out of sight, the pecking behavior stops. The system relies on geometry, not training, to prevent egg damage and egg-eating habits.
