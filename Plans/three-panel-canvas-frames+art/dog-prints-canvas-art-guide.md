# Dog Paw Print Art — Non-Toxic Paint & Methods

## DO NOT FORGET (Critical Setup)

- Run painter’s paper underneath the border of the canvas and tape it down
- Tape on top of the canvas around the outer border, leaving the center exposed to create a clean visual margin
- Remove the tape after the paint dries, slowly

## Non-Toxic, Dog-Safe Paint (DIY)

Homemade paint is actually **safer and better** than most store-bought “washable” paints for dog paw prints.

This section includes **two proven recipes** plus the safety rules that matter.

---

## The Safest Option: Edible Dog-Safe Paint

This is the **gold standard** if paws might get licked.

### Recipe 1: Cornstarch + Food Coloring Paint

Safe even if ingested in small amounts.

### Ingredients

- Cornstarch
- Cold water
- Food coloring (regular or gel)

### Steps

- Mix **1 tablespoon cornstarch** with **1 tablespoon cold water** until smooth
- Add food coloring **drop by drop** until the desired shade is reached

### Texture Goal

Thin yogurt consistency  
Not runny water

### Why This Works

- Cornstarch is food-grade
- Food coloring is edible
- Dries matte and transfers cleanly to canvas drop cloth
- Washes off paws easily with warm water

### Best Colors

- Black
- Gray
- Brown
- Other muted tones

Bright reds and greens can look harsh on natural canvas.

---

## Slightly More Durable (Still Safe)

For stronger prints with less smudging.

### Recipe 2: Flour + Water Finger Paint

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/2 cup water
- Food coloring

### Steps

- Whisk flour and water over low heat until thickened (pudding consistency)
- Let cool completely
- Add food coloring

### Safety Note

Non-toxic, but not edible-tasty  
Supervise to prevent licking

---

## What NOT to Use (Important)

Do **not** use:

- Acrylic paint (even “non-toxic” versions)
- Tempera paint
- Essential oils
- Cocoa powder
- Charcoal
- Latex house paint

“Non-toxic” for humans does **not** mean safe for animals.

---

## Color Recipes (Food Coloring Only)

### Best Charcoal Black Formula

Use this ratio:

- Blue: 4 drops
- Green: 2 drops
- Red: 1 drop

Add to your cornstarch or flour paint base.

Adjust slowly:

- Too blue → add 1/2 drop red
- Too green → add 1/2 drop blue + 1/2 drop red
- Too brown → add 1 drop blue

Target color:  
Dark storm-cloud gray, not ink.

---

### Soft Gray (Modern, Subtle)

- Blue: 1 drop
- Green: 1 drop
- Add water to lighten

Great for:

- Light dogs
- Minimalist rooms
- Natural linen canvas

---

### Warm Gray / Greige

- Blue: 1 drop
- Red: 1 drop
- Optional: tiny touch of yellow (1/4 drop via toothpick)

Reads elegant and neutral once dry.

---

### Brown (Natural, Forgiving)

- Red: 2 drops
- Green: 1 drop
- Optional: 1/2 drop blue to cool it down

Brown hides imperfect prints beautifully.

---

## Prep the Dog (Do Not Skip)

### Brush First

- Removes loose fur that will fall into wet paint
- Prevents wispy hairs from smearing prints
- Makes prints crisper, especially for shedders

How:

- Brush immediately before starting
- Use a slicker or deshedding brush
- Focus on:
  - Legs
  - Ankles
  - Chest
  - Belly fringe (if applicable)

Do **not** bathe the dog right before unless absolutely necessary  
Damp fur causes mess

---

### Wash and Dry Paws

Why:

- Dirt and oils repel paint
- Grit causes blotchy prints
- Clean pads = even transfer

How:

- Warm water
- Mild soap if muddy
- Rinse well
- Dry completely with a towel

Paint goes on **dry paws only**.

---

## Dog-Specific Paint Recipes (For my dogs)

### Chocolate Lab, 70–75 lb, sheds

Tone: warm charcoal (second-darkest)

- Blue: 3 drops
- Red: 2 drops
- Green: 1 drop

If it looks slightly brown when wet, that is correct.  
It cools as it dries.

---

### Black Lab, ~65 lb, tight coat

Tone: deep neutral charcoal (darkest panel)

- Blue: 4 drops
- Green: 2 drops
- Red: 1 drop

Should read almost black once framed.

---

### Chocolate Lab, ~45 lb, very tight coat

Tone: clean mid-charcoal

- Blue: 3 drops
- Green: 1 drop
- Red: 1 drop

To lighten slightly, add **2–3 drops water**, not less dye.

---

### Shepsky, white coat, heavy shed, 70–80 lb

Tone: soft mid-gray (lightest panel)

- Blue: 2 drops
- Green: 1 drop
- Red: 1/2 drop (use toothpick)

Then add:

- 1/2 teaspoon extra water

This is intentionally lighter and softer.

---

### Final Color Rules

- Never aim for jet black
- Thin layers are better than more dye
- Always test on scrap canvas and let dry
- Stop early — subtle reads less DIY

---

## How to Do Dog Paw Prints (Without Stress)

The goal is **calm cooperation for 30–90 seconds**.  
Not obedience. Not perfection.

---

## Method 1: Individual Paw Prints (Controlled)

Best for:

- Clean, intentional prints
- Framed or symmetrical layouts
- Dogs that tolerate paw handling

### Positioning

- Sitting naturally
- Standing calmly with light support

Avoid restraining or lifting paws unnecessarily.

### Apply Paint

- Use sponge, makeup brush, or soft cloth
- One paw at a time
- Thin, even coat
- Do not dip paws

### Make the Print

1. Place canvas flat on the floor
2. Support leg gently at wrist or ankle
3. Press paw straight down
4. Lift straight up
5. Wipe paw immediately

One clean press is enough.

---

## Method 2: Walk-Across Paw Prints (Natural Movement)

Best for:

- Abstract layouts
- Dogs that dislike paw handling

### Paint Application

- Apply paint to all four paws
- Thin, even coat
- No dripping

### Walk Across

- One calm walk across the canvas
- Use a neutral voice or treat
- Tossing treats ahead can help

Do not repeat excessively.

---

### After Painting

- Wipe all paws immediately
- Calm praise
- Lead dog away
- Let paint dry fully

---

## Multi-Dog Tip

If using multiple dogs:

- Let paint dry fully between dogs
- Lint roll the canvas
- Re-tape borders if needed
- Repeat process with next dog

---

## After the Paint Dries

1. Remove tape slowly
2. Lint roll the canvas
3. Allow full cure before framing
