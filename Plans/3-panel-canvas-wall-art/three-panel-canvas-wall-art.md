# Three-Panel Canvas Wall Art (Dog Paw Print Frames)

Minimal, modern three-panel wall art using canvas drop cloth and painted wood frames.
Designed to be non-toxic, affordable, and clean-looking.

Built using exactly two boards with no buffer.

## Overview

This project creates three vertical framed canvas panels suitable for dog paw-print art or abstract texture.

Goals:
- Clean lines
- Soft neutral canvas texture
- Painted frames that visually disappear
- No unnecessary complexity

Frames use simple butt joints and are painted after assembly.

Dry-stack all pieces before assembly.

## Assembly Instructions

### Dry Fit

Lay out one frame:
- Two verticals at 36 inches
- Two horizontals at 18 inches

Horizontals sit between verticals.
Check square.

### Glue and Fasten

- Apply wood glue to each joint
- Hold square
- Fasten with two brad nails or screws per corner
- Wipe glue immediately

Repeat for all three frames.

### Paint

- Lightly sand cut ends
- Touch up primer if needed
- Paint entire frame using interior trim paint
- Finish should be matte or eggshell
- Let cure fully

## Canvas Preparation

- Wash drop cloth once with no fabric softener
- Dry fully
- Cut into three pieces slightly larger than frame openings

## Canvas Attachment

- Lay canvas face-down
- Center frame on top
- Staple center of one long side
- Pull opposite side snug and staple
- Repeat for short sides
- Work outward toward corners
- Trim excess fabric

## Hanging

- Use D-rings, sawtooth hangers, or picture wire
- Suggested spacing is 2 to 3 inches between panels
- Level center panel first

## Notes

- This two-board plan works but leaves no margin for error
- Measure carefully
- Cut in order
- Do not rush
- A third board adds safety but is not required

## Optional Variations

- Increase panel width
- Leave wood unpainted
- Add hardboard backing instead of stapling canvas
