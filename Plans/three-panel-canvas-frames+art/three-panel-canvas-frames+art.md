# Three-Panel Canvas Wall Art (Dog Paw Print Frames)

Minimal, modern three-panel wall art using canvas drop cloth and painted wood frames.
Designed to be non-toxic, affordable, and clean-looking.

Built using exactly two boards with no buffer.

## Overview

This project creates three vertical framed canvas panels suitable for dog paw-print art or abstract texture.

Goals:
- Clean lines
- Soft neutral canvas texture
- Painted frames that visually disappear
- No unnecessary complexity

Frames use simple butt joints and are painted after assembly.

## Materials

| Item | Quantity | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | ----- |
| 1x2 x 16-ft primed finger-jointed boards | 2 | Painted finish hides joints |
| Canvas drop cloth | 1 (4 ft x 12 ft, 10 oz) | Wash once before use |
| Wood glue | 1 bottle | Interior |
| Brad nails or small screws | ~24 | Two per joint |
| Interior trim paint | 1 quart | Matte or eggshell |
| Staples | 1 box | For canvas attachment |
| Staple gun | 1 | Manual is fine |

## Finished Dimensions

Each framed panel (outer dimensions):

| Width | Height | Depth |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 18 in | 36 in | ~1.5 in |

## Cut List (Exact)

Three frames total.

Each frame requires:
- Two vertical sides
- Two horizontal sides

Total pieces required:

| Length | Quantity |
| ------ | -------- |
| 36 in | 6 |
| 18 in | 6 |

No extras. No buffer.

## Board Layout (Two-Board Plan)

Each board is 192 inches long.

### Board A

### Individual Frame Pieces (One Frame)

Each frame consists of:
- 2 vertical pieces @ 36"
- 2 horizontal pieces @ 18"

## Assembly Instructions

### Dry Fit

Lay out one frame:
- Two verticals at 36 inches
- Two horizontals at 18 inches

Horizontals sit between verticals.
Check square.

### Glue and Fasten

- Apply wood glue to each joint
- Hold square
- Fasten with two brad nails or screws per corner
- Wipe glue immediately

Repeat for all three frames.

### Paint

- Lightly sand cut ends
- Touch up primer if needed
- Paint entire frame using interior trim paint
- Finish should be matte or eggshell
- Let cure fully


### Choose the Best Drop Cloth Weight

Recommended weight: **10 oz canvas**

Why:
- Absorbs paint cleanly without bleeding
- Holds structure when framed
- Wrinkles less after washing
- Looks closer to artist canvas or linen

Avoid:
- 6–8 oz (too thin, looks crafty, warps easily)
- Plastic-backed or “dust sheet” styles

If only one option is available, choose the **heaviest canvas that is still flexible**.

---

### Soften the Canvas (Make It Look Expensive)

New drop cloth canvas is stiff because of factory sizing.

To soften:
1. Wash once in warm water
2. Use **no fabric softener**
3. Tumble dry on low or medium until fully dry
4. Optional: repeat wash for extra softness

Result:
- Less stiffness
- Better drape
- More “linen-like” texture
- Paint sits into fibers instead of on top

Do this **before painting or framing**.

## Canvas Preparation
- Cut into three pieces slightly larger than frame openings

## Canvas Attachment

- Lay canvas face-down
- Center frame on top
- Staple center of one long side
- Pull opposite side snug and staple
- Repeat for short sides
- Work outward toward corners
- Trim excess fabric


### Plan Wall Spacing (So It Looks Intentional)

Recommended spacing:
- **2–3 inches** between panels

Layout method:
1. Hang the center panel first
2. Level it carefully
3. Measure outward for the left and right panels
4. Keep spacing equal, not “eyeballed”

Rule of thumb:
- Narrow spacing = modern, gallery feel
- Wide spacing = casual, farmhouse feel

Consistency matters more than the exact number.

## Hanging

- Use D-rings, sawtooth hangers, or picture wire
- Reminder: Suggested spacing is 2 to 3 inches between panels
- Reminder: Level center panel first


### Choose Frame Thickness (Optional Chunkier Look)

Standard look:
- 1×2 boards (actual ~0.75" × 1.5")
- Clean, minimal, modern

Chunkier option:
- 1×3 boards (actual ~0.75" × 2.5")

Use thicker frames if:
- The wall is large
- The panels are oversized
- You want more visual weight

Avoid going thicker than 1×3 unless the art is very large.

Paint color matters more than thickness for perceived weight.


## Notes

- This two-board plan works but leaves no margin for error
- Measure carefully
- Cut in order
- Do not rush
- A third board adds safety but is not required

## Optional Variations

- Increase panel width
- Leave wood unpainted
- Add hardboard backing instead of stapling canvas

Depth comes from the 1x2 frame thickness (~1.5").
