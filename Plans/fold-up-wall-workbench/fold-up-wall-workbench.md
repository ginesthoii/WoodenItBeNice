# Fold-Up Wall Workbench

A compact, rock-solid fold-down workbench designed for garages or workshops. Wall mounted.  
Optimized for strength, smooth operation, and long-term sanity.

Target size: 80" W × 24" D × 34–36" H

## Design Goals

- One-handed deployment
- No wobble
- Distributed wall load
- Replaceable work surface
- Legs manage themselves
- Folds flat and locks safely

## Materials

### Lumber and Sheet Goods

- 1 × ¾" plywood sheet, 48" × 80" (work surface)
- 2 × 2×4 @ 80" (front and rear frame rails)
- 3 × 2×4 @ 21" (side rails and center brace)
- 2 × 4×4 @ 33" (legs, trim to height)
- 1 × ¼" hardboard or Masonite, 48" × 80" (optional sacrificial top)

### Hardware

- 1 × 80" piano hinge (heavy duty)
- 2 × locking folding shelf brackets (rated ≥300 lb per pair)
- 2 × heavy-duty leg hinges or spring-loaded folding legs
- 2 × adjustable leveling feet with T-nuts
- 3/8" × 3" lag screws (ledger to studs)
- 1¼" wood screws (frame)
- ¾" wood screws (sacrificial top)
- 1 × barrel bolt or slide latch (lock-up)
- Construction adhesive (optional)

### Tools Required

- Circular saw or table saw
- Drill and driver
- Stud finder
- Level
- Clamps
- Square
- Router with ⅛" round-over bit (recommended)

## Cut List

### 2×4

- 2 @ 80"
- 3 @ 21"

### 4×4

- 2 @ 33" (adjust to final working height)

### Sheet Goods

- ¾" plywood @ 48" × 80"
- Hardboard skin @ 48" × 80" (optional)

## Step-by-Step Build

### 1. Build the Frame

- Assemble a rectangle using the two 80" rails and two 21" side rails.
- Add the center brace at 40" for stiffness.
- Glue is optional. Screws are required.

### 2. Attach Frame to Work Surface

- Flip plywood upside down.
- Center frame with a 2" inset from the front edge.
- Screw from the underside every 8–10".

Cross-Section (Front Edge):

### 3. Install Sacrificial Top (Optional, but I recommend it)

- Screw hardboard skin from underneath only.
- This becomes the replaceable wear surface.

Layer Stack (Top to Bottom):

## Wall Mounting System
```
[ Hardboard (optional) ]
[ 3/4” Plywood        ]
[ 2x4 Frame           ]
```

### 4. Install Ledger or French Cleat

- Mount ledger board or French cleat directly into wall studs.
- Ledger must be dead level.

Wall Cross-Section:
```
| Stud | Stud | Stud |
|====== LEDGER ======|
```

### 5. Hinge the Table

- Attach piano hinge to the rear edge of the table.
- Attach hinge to ledger.
- Verify smooth movement before continuing.

Side View (Fold Axis):

```

## Support System

### 6. Folding Shelf Brackets

- Mount locking folding shelf brackets under the table.
- Position approximately 10" from each end.
- These prevent lateral sway and carry most of the load.

Side View (Deployed):

```

```

### 7. Folding Legs

- Install leg hinges at the inner corners of the frame.
- Add leveling feet to leg bottoms.
- Legs should fold automatically when the table is lifted.

## Safety and Finish

### 8. Lock-Up Mechanism

- Install a barrel bolt or slide latch to hold the table upright.
- Gravity is not a safety device.

Folded Position (Locked):
```
WALL

| [TABLE]
|   ||
| [LATCH]
```


### 9. Edge Treatment

- Route a ⅛" round-over on all exposed edges.
- Prevents splintering and shin damage.

### 10. Finish

- Paint or seal frame before final installation.
- Oil-based polyurethane or matte floor enamel recommended for the top.

## Load Rating (Conservative)

- Static load (deployed): 300–500 lb
- Depends on bracket rating and stud quality
- Not intended for hydraulic presses unless reinforced

## Optional Enhancements

- Power strip mounted under front edge
- French cleat tool wall above bench
- Magnetic tool strip under surface
- Integrated vise mounting plate
- T-track embedded in work surface

## Final Notes

This design favors load distribution over brute thickness, replaceable wear parts, and calm, predictable movement.

It folds flat.  
It does not rack.  
It does not surprise you.

This is the version you build once and stop thinking about.
