# Knife-Throwing Target (Pro End-Grain Build)

Durable, self-healing knife target made from end-grain 4√ó6 blocks, framed in 2√ó6s, backed with plywood.  
The goal: maximum knife stick, minimum bounce, zero drama.

---

## Overview
This is the **Pro** version ‚Äî the one built to last.  
Each block exposes end grain (the self-healing side of the wood).  
Blocks are removable, replaceable, and held inside a 2√ó6 frame on a ¬æ" plywood backer.

You can scale this design from **4√ó4 blocks (small)** to **4√ó6 blocks (tournament-style)**.

## Step-by-Step Build

### 1. Cut the Blocks
- Mark your 4√ó6 post every **5.5"** down its 96" length.  
- Use a miter saw (best) or circular saw.  
- Each cut piece = **5.5" √ó 5.5" √ó 3.5"**.  
- You‚Äôll get ~17 blocks per post.

---

### 2. Sort and Orient
- Pick the **cleanest end grain** for the front (knots ‚Üí sides or back).  
- Keep grain direction varied for best stability.  
- Rotate blocks if one starts splitting ‚Äî that‚Äôs normal end-grain behavior.

---

### 3. Build the Frame
- Use 2√ó6s to build a rectangle **22" wide √ó 33" tall (inside)**.  
- Screw corners together with 2.5" exterior screws.  
- Dry-fit the blocks ‚Äî they should sit snug.

---

### 4. Attach the Backer
- Center the frame on your plywood sheet.  
- Screw it down every 6‚Äì8".  
- Backer acts as the anchor for your screws.

---

### 5. Install Blocks
- Arrange 4 across √ó 6 down (24 total).  
- Clamp them tight; drive **3" screws** from the back into each block.  
- Check alignment; face should be flush.

---

### 6. Finishing Touches
- Add a strap handle to the top if you want to carry it.  
- Lightly mist with water or oil ‚Äî never polyurethane or epoxy.  
- Paint target rings (outer, middle, bullseye).  
- Let dry, then hang or mount securely.

## ü™µ Wood Tips

| Wood | Works? | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Pine / Spruce / Fir | ‚úÖ | Soft, ideal, self-healing |
| Douglas Fir | ‚úÖ | Slightly harder, still good |
| Cedar | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Splits easily |
| Oak / Maple / Hickory | ‚ùå | Too hard, dulls knives |

**Softwoods** are your friend ‚Äî if you can dent it with a thumbnail, it‚Äôs perfect.

## Optional Code Integration
The `scripts/cutlist.py` tool can read this project‚Äôs JSON plan and output a cut list.

Example:
```bash
python scripts/cutlist.py plans/knife_board_pro.json

Target face: 22" √ó 33"
Using 4√ó6 end-grain blocks ‚Üí 24 pieces @ 5.5"
Hardware: 3" construction screws, 2.5" frame screws
Notes: Rotate worn blocks; replace individually.
```
