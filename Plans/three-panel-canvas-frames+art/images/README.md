## Canvas

### Canvas Drop Cloth  
**Project Source 8 oz Canvas Drop Cloth — 4 ft × 15 ft**  
Lowe’s  
$22.98  

Chosen for:
- Extra length (room for mistakes)
- Better weight than thin craft canvas
- Natural linen look once framed

Note:  
Harbor Freight has a 4 ft × 12 ft, 10 oz version for ~$12, but the extra length here is worth it if you’re doing multiple dogs or want margin for error.

## Summary

- Uses **non-toxic, dog-safe materials**

- Produces **gallery-level results**, not DIY-looking craft art
- Is forgiving if you make mistakes

Total new spend depends on what you already own, but the **core consumables are inexpensive and reusable**.
