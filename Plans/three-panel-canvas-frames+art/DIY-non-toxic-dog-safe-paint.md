## Non-Toxic, Dog-Safe Paint (DIY)

Homemade paint is actually **safer and better** than most store-bought “washable” paints for dog paw prints.

This section includes **two proven recipes** plus the safety rules that actually matter.

## The Safest Option: Edible Dog-Safe Paint

This is the **gold standard** if paws might get licked.

### Recipe 1: Cornstarch + Food Coloring Paint

Safe even if ingested in small amounts.

#### Ingredients
- Cornstarch
- Cold water
- Food coloring (regular or gel)

#### Steps
- Mix **1 tablespoon cornstarch** with **1 tablespoon cold water** until smooth.
- Add food coloring **drop by drop** until desired shade is reached.

#### Texture Goal
Thin yogurt consistency.  
Not runny water.

#### Why This Works
- Cornstarch is food-grade
- Food coloring is edible
- Dries matte and transfers cleanly to canvas drop cloth
- Washes off paws easily with warm water

#### Best Colors
- Black
- Gray
- Brown
- Other muted tones

Bright reds and greens can look harsh on natural canvas.

## Slightly More Durable (Still Safe)

For stronger prints with less smudging.

### Recipe 2: Flour + Water Finger Paint

#### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/2 cup water
- Food coloring

#### Steps
- Whisk flour and water over low heat until thickened (pudding consistency).
- Let cool completely.
- Add food coloring.

#### Safety Note
Non-toxic, but not edible-tasty.  
Supervise to prevent licking.

## What NOT to Use (Important)

Do **not** use:
- Acrylic paint (even “non-toxic” versions)
- Tempera paint
- Essential oils
- Cocoa powder
- Charcoal
- Latex house paint

“Non-toxic” for humans does **not** mean safe for animals.

## How to Do the Prints Cleanly

This prevents chaos.

1. Wash and dry your dog’s paws first
2. Apply paint with a sponge or makeup brush (do not dip paws)
3. Press paw gently onto canvas
4. Lift straight up — no twisting
5. Wipe paw immediately with a damp towel
6. Praise and treat after each paw

Do **one paw at a time**.  
Four painted paws equals zoomies and abstract art on your couch.

## Canvas Drop Cloth Tip

Wash the drop cloth **once** before painting.

Factory sizing causes paint to bead and blur.  
One wash equals crisp prints.

## Final Verdict

Homemade paint is:
- Safer than store “washable” paint
- Cheaper
- Better looking on canvas
- Easier to clean off paws

## Optional Next Steps

- Choose the best drop cloth weight
- Learn how to soften canvas so it looks expensive
- Frame the pieces cleanly and cheaply
- Plan wall spacing so the set looks intentional
- Choose frame thickness for a chunkier look
