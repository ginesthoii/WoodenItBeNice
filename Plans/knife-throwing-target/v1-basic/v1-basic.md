# Knife-Throwing Target (Basic Version)

This is a simple, no-nonsense knife-throwing target most people should start with.  
It’s quick to build, inexpensive, and good enough to learn on without overthinking it.

If you’re not yet sure knife throwing is going to be a long-term hobby, this version makes sense.

## Overview

The basic target is made from standard dimensional lumber screwed directly to a plywood backer.  
The knives hit **face grain**, not end grain.

That means it works, but it wears out faster and doesn’t forgive sloppy throws. Over time the wood grooves, splits, and starts rejecting blades instead of catching them.

Still, it gets the job done.

## Materials

2×10 or 2×12 pine or fir boards  
¾" plywood for the backer  
2½"–3" construction screws  
Optional spray paint for target rings  

No frame, no blocks, no special joinery.

---

## Typical Size

Most people aim for something around:

Width: about 24"  
Height: about 36"  
Depth: about 1½" (the board thickness)

Cut the plywood to match or leave it slightly oversized.

## How to Build It

1. Cut the plywood to your target size.

2. Lay the boards across the plywood, either vertically or horizontally, until the face is covered.

3. Drive screws through the boards into the plywood every 6–8 inches. Keep them snug but don’t overthink spacing.

4. Paint a bullseye if you want something to aim at.

5. Mount it securely or lean it against a soft backstop. Avoid concrete or masonry behind it.

You can realistically build this in an afternoon and start throwing the same day.

## What to Expect

### Pros

It’s cheap and fast  
Easy to build with basic tools  
Perfectly fine for beginners  
Easy to replace when it’s worn out  

### Cons

Boards split along the grain over time
Knife stick is inconsistent  
Bounce-backs increase as grooves form  
The whole target wears out at once  

Once the face gets chewed up, knives tend to glance instead of bite.

## When This Version Is the Right Choice
First-time knife throwers  
Casual backyard use  
Budget under $40–60  
You want something temporary or portable  
Testing interest before committing - you just want to see if you enjoy it  

This is the “try it first” target, not the forever one.

## Natural Upgrade Path

Most people follow the same arc:

Simple face-grain board  
→ wood gets beat up  
→ stick rate drops  
→ bounce-backs increase  
→ curiosity about end grain  
→ Pro end-grain block target
